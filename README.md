## 📌 Project Abstract

### Background
Flight pricing is dynamic and influenced by factors such as demand, seasonality, distance, and availability. Price variability is particularly pronounced during peak travel seasons, such as summer. Our goal is to develop a predictive model to estimate ticket prices based on key variables, including travel dates, distance, airline, and ticket characteristics.

### Problem Definition
Our project addresses two key questions:
1. Can we predict airfare prices to assist travelers in knowing the best time to book?
2. What features contribute to airfare pricing?

Using the Expedia dataset, our model will incorporate features such as:
- Departure and arrival dates
- Travel distance
- Cabin class
- Airline
- Ticket attributes (e.g., refundable, non-stop, etc.)

The output of our model will be the predicted ticket price.

### Success Criteria
Our model's success will be measured using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for prediction accuracy
- **R-Squared (R²)** to measure variance explanation
- **Feature Importance Analysis** to identify key drivers of price
- **Comparison between Linear Regression, LSTM, and Random Forest** to assess trade-offs between interpretability and performance

## 📊 Results

### 1️⃣ Model Performance Summary
Our experiments evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict airfare prices. Below are the key performance metrics:

| Model            | RMSE   | MAE    | R² Score |
|-----------------|--------|--------|----------|
| 🏆 **Random Forest (Best Performing)** | 0.0081 | 0.0110 | 0.9997   |
| 📏 **Linear Regression (Baseline Model)** | N/A    | 0.2250 | 0.4167   |
| 🔄 **LSTM (Time-Series Model, Underperformed)** | N/A    | 120.76 | -0.0469  |

### 2️⃣ Key Findings
- ✅ **Random Forest performed the best**, achieving a near-perfect R² score (0.9997), meaning it can predict airfare prices with high accuracy.
- 📉 **Linear Regression struggled**, indicating that airfare prices do not follow a purely linear trend.
- ❌ **LSTM underperformed significantly**, suggesting that airfare prices **do not exhibit strong sequential dependencies**, making deep learning models less effective for this use case.
- 📊 **Feature Importance Analysis** showed that `price per mile`, `previous day’s fare`, and `total travel distance` were the most influential factors in predicting ticket prices.
- ✈️ **Seasonal trends were observed**, with higher fares around major holidays like **July 4th**.

### 3️⃣ Implications
- 🏷️ **Consumers**: Travelers can use this model to optimize booking decisions, helping them secure lower fares.
- 🏢 **Industry Stakeholders**: Airlines and travel agencies can leverage these insights to refine dynamic pricing strategies.
- 🔄 **Future Improvements**: Expanding the dataset to include multiple years and additional airports may further improve prediction accuracy.
