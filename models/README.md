# Models Documentation

This directory contains trained and serialized machine learning models used for predicting airfare prices for domestic flights departing from Los Angeles (LAX) during peak summer months (Juneâ€“August). Each model was developed, trained, evaluated, and version-controlled to ensure reproducibility and efficient model management.

## Included Models

### âœ… 1. **Random Forest Regression (Primary Model)**
- **File:** `random_forest_model.pkl`
- **Framework:** scikit-learn
- **Purpose:** Primary prediction model; chosen for its superior accuracy, handling of nonlinear data, and robustness to outliers.
- **Performance:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 
  - **RÂ² Score:** 
- **Features used:** 
  -

### âœ… 2. **Linear Regression (Baseline Model)**
- **Filename:** `linear_regression_model.pkl`
- **Framework:** scikit-learn
- **Purpose:** Serves as an interpretable baseline comparison.
- **Performance:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 
  - **RÂ² Score:** 
- **Limitations:** Struggled with nonlinearities in pricing data; high sensitivity to outliers.

---

### âœ… 3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**
- **Filename:** `lstm_model.keras`
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Purpose:** Designed to capture short-term sequential pricing trends.
- **Performance:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 
  - **RÂ² Score:** 
- **Limitations:** Limited historical data restricted its performance, indicating that additional data may enhance future predictions.

## ðŸš€ How to Load the Models

### âœ… **Loading Random Forest or Linear Regression (scikit-learn):**
```python
import joblib

# Load trained Random Forest or Linear Regression model
model = joblib.load('models/random_forest_model.pkl')

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test) 

```
### âœ… **Loading LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load trained LSTM model
model = load_model('models/lstm_model.keras')

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test_sequence)
```
