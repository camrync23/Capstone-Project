# Models Documentation

This directory contains trained and serialized machine learning models used for predicting airfare prices for domestic flights departing from Los Angeles (LAX) during peak summer months (June‚ÄìAugust). Each model was developed, trained, evaluated, and version-controlled to ensure reproducibility and efficient model management.

## üìä Dataset Used

- **Source:** Historical airfare pricing data from Kaggle.
- **Size:** XX,XXX rows and XX columns.
- **Key Features:**
  - `pricePerMile`: Cost per mile traveled.
  - `fareLag_1`: Previous day's airfare price.
  - `totalTravelDistance`: Total flight distance.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - **Log transformation** applied to `totalFare` to reduce skewness.
  - **Categorical features** encoded using frequency encoding.
  - **Highly correlated features** removed (correlation > 0.85).

## üìå Included Models

The repository includes three models, each serving a distinct purpose:

### ‚úÖ 1. **Random Forest Regression (Primary Model)**
- **File:** `random_forest_model.pkl`
- **Framework:** scikit-learn
- **Purpose:** 
    - Selected for its high accuracy, ability to handle nonlinear relationships, and robustness to outliers.
    - Serves as the primary prediction model for airfare prices.
 - **Structure & Parameters:**
  - **Number of Trees (`n_estimators`)**: 100
  - **Max Depth (`max_depth`)**: 20
  - **Min Samples Split (`min_samples_split`)**: 5
  - **Min Samples Leaf (`min_samples_leaf`)**: 2
  - **Feature Selection:** Used **permutation importance** and **SHAP analysis**.
#### üìä **Performance**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `0.0110`
  - **R¬≤ Score:** `0.9997`
**- **Features used:** **
  - Feature selection based on permutation importance and SHAP analysis.
  - Below are the top features used in the Random Forest Regression model, ranked by importance:

    | Feature              | Importance Score |
    |----------------------|----------------:|
    | pricePerMile        | 0.444068         |
    | fareLag_1           | 0.242052         |
    | totalTravelDistance | 0.092293         |

  > **Interpretation:** The **higher the score**, the greater the feature's impact on predicting airfare prices.
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Constraints & Limitations**
- Performs well **when past airfare trends are stable**.
- **Struggles with sudden, extreme airfare fluctuations** (e.g., flash sales, emergency price hikes).
- May not **generalize well** to airlines/routes not present in the training data.

### ‚úÖ 2. **Linear Regression (Baseline Model)**
- **Filename:** `linear_regression_model.pkl`
- **Framework:** scikit-learn
- **Purpose:**
   - Serves as a simple and interpretable baseline comparison.
    - Helps assess whether a simpler model can perform well against more complex models.
#### üîπ **Model Structure & Variants**
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression** (Baseline model)
- **Ridge Regression** (Handles multicollinearity, optimized with `alpha=10`)
- **Lasso Regression** (Feature selection, `alpha=0.01`)
- **Polynomial Regression (Degree=2)** (Captures some nonlinear relationships)
- **Feature Selection with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**  
  - **Top 5 Selected Features:**
    - `pricePerMile`
    - `postHolidayFlight`
    - `totalLayoverTime`
    - `durationToDistanceRatio`
    - `cabin_classes_ordinal`

#### üìä **Performance Comparison**
| Model Type                       | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | R¬≤ Score |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------:|
| **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** | `0.2250`                | `0.4167` |
| **Ridge Regression (`alpha=10`)** | `0.2250`                | `0.4166` |
| **Lasso Regression (`alpha=0.01`)** | `0.2927`                | `0.1158` |
| **Polynomial Regression (Degree=2)** | `0.2169`                | `0.4801` |
| **Ridge (Top 5 Selected Features)** | `0.2254`                | `0.4149` |

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Constraints & Limitations**
- **Struggles with nonlinearities** in airfare pricing data.  
- **Highly sensitive to outliers**, which **Ridge/Lasso partially address**.  
- **Polynomial Regression improves performance** but **adds complexity**.  
- **RFE shows that only 5 key features contribute meaningfully**, which may help simplify the model.

### ‚úÖ 3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**
- **Filename:** `lstm_model.keras`
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Purpose:**
   - Designed to capture short-term sequential pricing trends.
   - Evaluates how past airfare fluctuations affect future prices.
- **Performance:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `120.37`
  - **R¬≤ Score:** `-.0457`
- **Limitations:**
    - Limited historical data restricted its ability to learn meaningful trends.  
    - LSTMs typically require large amounts of sequential data to perform well.  
    - Additional data and feature engineering could significantly improve model performance.
