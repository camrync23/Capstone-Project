# Models Documentation

This directory contains trained and serialized machine learning models used for predicting airfare prices for domestic flights departing from Los Angeles (LAX) during peak summer months (Juneâ€“August). Each model was developed, trained, evaluated, and version-controlled to ensure reproducibility and efficient model management.

## Included Models

The repository includes three models, each serving a distinct purpose:

### âœ… 1. **Random Forest Regression (Primary Model)**
- **File:** `random_forest_model.pkl`
- **Framework:** scikit-learn
- **Purpose:** 
    - Selected for its high accuracy, ability to handle nonlinear relationships, and robustness to outliers.
    - Used as the primary prediction model for airfare prices.
- **Performance:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `0.0110`
  - **RÂ² Score:** `0.9997`
- **Features used:** 
  - Feature selection based on permutation importance and SHAP analysis.
  - Below are the top features used in the Random Forest Regression model, ranked by importance:

    | Feature              | Importance Score |
    |----------------------|----------------:|
    | pricePerMile        | 0.444068         |
    | fareLag_1           | 0.242052         |
    | totalTravelDistance | 0.092293         |

  > **Interpretation:** The **higher the score**, the greater the feature's impact on predicting airfare prices.

### âœ… 2. **Linear Regression (Baseline Model)**
- **Filename:** `linear_regression_model.pkl`
- **Framework:** scikit-learn
- **Purpose:**
   - Serves as a simple and interpretable baseline comparison.
    - Helps assess whether a simpler model can perform well against more complex models.
- **Performance:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `0.2250`
  - **RÂ² Score:** `0.4167`
- **Limitations:**
   - Struggled with nonlinearities in pricing data
   - Highly sensitive to outliers, leading to reduced predictive power.
   - Performed significantly worse than Random Forest, indicating that airfare pricing patterns are not well captured by a simple linear model.

### âœ… 3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**
- **Filename:** `lstm_model.keras`
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Purpose:**
   - Designed to capture short-term sequential pricing trends.
   - Evaluates how past airfare fluctuations affect future prices.
- **Performance:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `120.37`
  - **RÂ² Score:** `-.0457`
- **Limitations:**
    - Limited historical data restricted its ability to learn meaningful trends.  
    - LSTMs typically require large amounts of sequential data to perform well.  
    - Additional data and feature engineering could significantly improve model performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Load the Models

### âœ… **Loading Random Forest or Linear Regression (scikit-learn):**
```python
import joblib

# Load trained Random Forest or Linear Regression model
model = joblib.load('models/random_forest_model.pkl')

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test) 

```
### âœ… **Loading LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load trained LSTM model
model = load_model('models/lstm_model.keras')

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test_sequence)
```
